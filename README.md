# Weapon Inspection mod for Cyberpunk 2077

Ref: [Always First Equip](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2557)

## This time, V triggers the First Equip animation every time you pull out the weapon, instead of probabilistically.

## Similar to the Weapon Inspection in Valorant, the animation will be triggered every time the shortcut key is pressed.

Although 2077 can also achive this after updates, by holding the unsheathe button, but we have to sheathe the weapon first, this is too bulky !!!

If you want to change the button: 
1. go to "<Cyberpunk 2077>\r6\input" folder
2. open "WeaponInspection.xml" with any text editor
3. find and replace "IK_Y" with any other hotkey codes

Hotkeys reference list is [available here](https://nativedb.red4ext.com/EInputKey)

## And this is an unfinished mod
cause I could't find a suitable animation for ranged weapon.
